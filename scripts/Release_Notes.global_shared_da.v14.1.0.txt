IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
* To implement global_shared_da.v14.1.0, please do the following:
  * cd  $NWROOThps
  * svn checkout https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gfs/tags/global_shared.v14.1.0
  * cd $NWROOThps/global_shared.v14.1.0/sorc
  * execute "./build_gsi.sh cray" - This builds the global_gsi executable on Cray and places it $NWROOThps/global_shared.v14.1.0/exec
