RELEASE NOTES:  gfs_da.v14.1.0
 v14.1.0 - released Nov 22, 2016


SVN HISTORY  (see EMC GSI Trac ticket #603, EMC GFS Trac ticket #239)
 * r84764 - initial Q3FY17 NEMS GFS DA release


CODE CHANGES
 * No code change 


JOB CHANGES
 * JGFS_ANALYSIS
   * update environment variables to run on WCOSS Cray
   * add NSST option
   * define variables for new observation datasets
   * update to use new GFS filename convention
   * update to read/write nemsio files


SCRIPT CHANGES
 * No script change.   See global_shared.v14.1.0 da release notes for analysis script changes


RESOURCE INFORMATION
 * Current operational GFS runs on WCOSS phase2 nodes.   Q3FY17 NEMS GFS package should be implemented on WCOSS Cray.
 * Timing tests only run on production Cray:  Luna before 12/30/2016 switch.  Surge after 12/30/2016 switch.
   Surge run times tend to be a bit higher than Luna.   Run times on development Cray are higher and much more
   variables.   The Cray configurations given below result in GFS and GDAS/EnKF run times comparable to or faster
   than current Phase2 operations.  This was intentionally done.  It is easy to dial back and slow down jobs.
   Ideally would like to see Cray GFS analysis and GDAS/EnKF suite run in same time as current Phase2 operations.
   This is achievable by altering job configurations.  Most DA job configurations may be altered without changing
   analysis results.   Tuning job configurations should be done one NCO is able to run entire cycle.
 * JGFS_ANALYSIS
   * job configuration
     * current operations:  240 nodes, 480 tasks, ptile=2, 12 threads
     * propose operations:  240 nodes, 480 tasks, ptile=2, 12 threads
   * run time
      * current operations:  20.0 - 20.9 minutes
      * propose operations:  20.1 - 20.6 minutes (Luna); 21.7 - 22.3 minutes (Surge)
        See ../driver/test_gfs_analysis.sh for job submission
 * Disk space required per day for gfs da files
   * /com/gfs/prod/gfs.$PDY (only JGFS_ANALYSIS output)
     * current operations:  16.7 Gb
     * propose operations:  38.6 Gb (additional 21.9 Gb).  Increase due to (1) transition to nemsio, (2) addition of NSST files
   * frequency of run
     * 6 hourly cycle (00, 06, 12, 18Z)
 * Specify all versions of libs, compilers, shared code being used
   * gfs.v14.1.0 only contains jobs/JGFS_ANALYSIS and parm/gfs_analysis.parm.  No libraries or compilers are required to install gfs_da.v14.1.0
 * Data retention for files in $COMROOThps and $GESROOThps
   * same as current operations


PRE-IMPLEMENTATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS
 * Which production jobs should be tested as part of this implementation?
   * gfs.v14.1.0 should be tested as part of the Q3FY17 NEMS GFS package
 * Does this change require a 30-day evaluation?
   * YES
 * Suggested evaluators
   * same as rest of Q3FY17 NEMS GFS package


DISSEMINATION INFORMATION
 * Where should this output be sent?
   * same as current operational GFS/GDAS GSI
 * Who are the users?
   * same as current operational GFS/GDAS GSI
 * Which output files should be transferred from PROD WCOSS to DEV WCOSS?
   * same as current operational GFS/GDAS GSI - note that v14.1.0 changes the names of operational GFS files
   * add transfer of following NSST files
     * gfs.t${cyc}z.nstanl.nemsio
     * gfs.t${cyc}z.sfcgcy
     * gfs.t${cyc}z.sfctsk
