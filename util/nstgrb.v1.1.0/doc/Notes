Utility to generate RTG-like and OISST-like SST files with NSST SST analysis

Xu Li

Background

The daily global NCEP RTG SST analysis will not be transferred to Dell computer system (WCOSS Phase-3) and will be discontinued. Although this doesn’t affect the operational NCEP GFS since the SST required is produced by the NSST within the NCEP GFS, some downstream users still use the RTG SST analysis. 
This utility is to generate a RTG-like SST files with the operational NSST SST analysis.
The OISST-like SST file is generated with this utility as well due to the same reason.

Method

All the grids are provided a temperature value as follows:

1.Water grids
   The value can be one of the three situations:
   (1) Interpolated with nearby 4-grid foundation temperature (Tf) analysis of the NSST analysis, at T1534 Gaussian grids (about 1/10 lat/lon degree) and has valid value for open water grids only.
   (2) Searched NSST Tf analysis with 500 km search radius when none of the nearby 4-grid is water
   (3) RTG SST climatology valid at the analysis time if no water grid can be searched in 500 km range
2. The grids with sea ice concentration greater than 15%
   A frozen point temperature is calculated with a salinity dependent formula. The monthly salinity climatology is used in this calculation.
3. Land grids
   Filled by solving a Lapalacian equation with the water boundaries. 

Input

1. FV3GFS surface analysis file at 12 Z at T1534 Gausian grids (in nemsio binary format currently, and will be in netcdf format since gfsv16)
2. Sea ice concentration analysis (blended) file at 12 Z 
3. RTG monthly SST climatology at 1/12 lat/lon grids
4. Monthly salinity climatology at T1534 Gaussian grids, interpolated from 1 degree Levitus surface salinity climatology.
5. Surface mask fix file for ½, ¼ and 1/12 lat/lon grids
