cov_calc computes interchannel observation covariances based on Desroziers' method.

This program uses the radstat.gdas.$date files, and outputs four binary files.  The first binary file contains the covariance matrix (plus extra information about the matrix), the second contains the wavenumbers of the satellite instrument, and the third contains the assumed obs error. (The wavenumbers and assumed obs errors can used for plotting).  The fourth file is simply the correlation matrix, which can readily be plotted with plot_cov.m

For convenience, get_rads.sh can be used to retrieve radstat files from hpss

To run this program, edit the parameters in the first few lines of run.sh.  Compile by typing 'make'.  (To make clean type 'make clean').  Then submit the job by typing 'qsub submit_job.sh' (zeus) or 'bsub < submit_job.sh' (WCOSS).  It may be necessary to change the requested compute time.
