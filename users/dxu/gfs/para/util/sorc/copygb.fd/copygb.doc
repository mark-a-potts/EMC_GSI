 NAME
      copygb - copies GRIB files


 SYNOPSIS
      copygb [-g "grid [kgds]"] [-i "ip [ipopts]"]
             [-k "kpds"] [-v "uparms"] [-X]
             [-B mapgrib [-b mapindex] [-A "<> mapthreshold"] [-K "mapkpds"]]
             [-M "mask"] [-a]
      then either:
             grib1 index1 grib2
           or:
             -x grib1 grib2


 DESCRIPTION
      The command copygb copies all or part of one GRIB file to another
      GRIB file, interpolating if necessary.  Unless otherwise directed
      (-x option), the GRIB index file is also used to speed the reading.
      The fields are interpolated to an output grid if specified (-g option).
      The interpolation type defaults to bilinear but may be specified directly
      (-i option).  The copying may be limited to specific fields (-k option).
      It may also be limited to a specified subgrid of the output grid
      or to a subrange of the input fields (-B and -b, -A, and -K options).
      Fields can be identified as scalars or vectors (-v option), which are
      interpolated differently.  The invalid data in the output field can be
      filled with mask values or merged with a merge field (-M and -m options).
      The output GRIB message can also be appended to a file (-a option).
      If grib2 is specified as '-', then the output GRIB file is written
      to standard output.

    Options
           -a
                          Appends rather than overwrites the output GRIB file.

           -A "<> mapthreshold"
                          Inequality and threshold used in determining
                          where on the map the data will be copied.
                          The data are copied only where the given
                          map field is on the correct side of the threshold.
                          The mapthreshold defaults to '>-1.e30'; in this case,
                          only the map field's bitmap will limit the domain.

           -b mapindex
                          Optional index file used to get the map field.

           -B mapgrib
                          GRIB file used to get the map field.  The map field
                          is read from the GRIB file and compared to the
                          map threshold to determine for which region on the map
                          the data will be copied.  The mapgrib can be the name
                          of an actual GRIB file (in which case the index
                          file may be specified with the -b option) or it can
                          be '-1'.  If mapgrib is '-1', then the input GRIB file
                          (first positional argument) is used.
                          The -K option specifies which field to read from
                          the mapgrib GRIB file.  If mapgrib is an actual file,
                          then the first field is taken if -K is not specified.
                          On the other hand, if mapgrib is '-1', then if the
                          if -K is not specified, the current field is taken
                          as the map field.  A special exception is if -K '-1'
                          is specified, in which case the current field is
                          taken as the map field and it is applied before any
                          interpolation; otherwise the map field is always
                          applied after interpolation.

           -g "grid [kgds]"
                          Output grid identification.  If grid=-1 (the default),
                          then the output grid is the same as the input grid.
                          If grid=-4, then the grid is that of the map field.
                          If grid=-5, then the grid is that of the merge field.
                          If 0<grid<255, then grid designates an NCEP grid.
                          If grid=255, then the grid must be specified by the
                          full set of kgds parameters determining a GRIB GDS
                          (grid description section) in the W3FI63 format.

           -i "ip [ipopts]"
                          Interpolation options.  The default is bilinear
                          interpolation (ip=0).  Other interpolation options
                          are bicubic (ip=1), neighbor (ip=2), budget (ip=3),
                          and spectral (ip=4).  Spectral interpolation is forced
                          even if the input and output grids are the same.
                          See the documentation for iplib for further details.

           -k "kpds"
                          Full set of kpds parameters determing a GRIB PDS
                          (product definition section) in the W3FI63 format
                          determining the field(s) to be copied.  Note that
                          kpds(5) is the parameter indicator (PDS octet 9).
                          A wildcard is specified by -1 (the defaults).
                          If "kpds" is equal to "w", then the requested record
                          numbers are read in from standard input instead,
                          one record per line and possibly delimited by a colon
                          (so that wgrib could pipe requests to copygb).
                          If the -k is not specified, then copygb will attempt
                          to copy every field in the input GRIB file.

           -K "mapkpds"
                          Full set of kpds parameters determing a GRIB PDS
                          (product definition section) in the W3FI63 format
                          determining the map field to be used to determine
                          where on the map the data will be copied.
                          A wildcard is specified by -1 (the defaults).

           -m mergeindex
                          Optional index file used to get the merge field.

           -M "mask"/mergegrib
                          Mask used to fill out bitmapped areas of the map.
                          If specified, there will be no bitmap in the output.
                          The mask must be in the format '#value' where value
                          is the real number used to fill out the field.
                          Otherwise, the argument is interpreted as a merge
                          GRIB file.  Then for each GRIB message copied,
                          a merge field is found in the merge GRIB file
                          with the same parameter and level indicators
                          as the copied field.  This merge field is interpolated
                          to the output grid and used to fill out the bitmapped
                          areas of the map, at least where the merge field
                          is not bitmapped.  No merging is done if no merge
                          field is found.

           -N namelist
                          Namelist file to override default output options.
                          The namelist must start with &NLCOPYGB and end with /.
                          Namelist variables are:
                            IDS(255)      Output decimal scaling by parameter
                            IBS(255)      Output binary scaling by parameter
                            NBS(255)      Output number of bits by parameter

           -v "uparms"
                          Parameter indicator(s) for the u-component of vectors.
                          The parameter indicator for the v-component is assumed
                          to be one more than that of the u-component.
                          If the -v option is not specified, then the wind
                          components (parameters 33 and 34) are the only fields
                          assumed to be vector components in the GRIB file.

           -x
                          Turns off the use of an index file.  The index records
                          are then extracted from the GRIB file, which
                          will increase the time taken by copygb.

           -X
                          Turns on verbose printout.  This option is
                          incompatible with GRIB output to standard output.
