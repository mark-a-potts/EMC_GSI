 NAME
      copygb2 - copies GRIB2 files


 SYNOPSIS
      copygb2 [-g "kgdtn [kgdt]"] [-i "ip [ipopts]"]
             [-k "kpdtn kpdt"] [-v "uparms"] [-X]
             [-B mapgrib [-b mapindex] [-A "<> mapthreshold"] [-K "mapkpds"]]
             [-M "mask"|mergegrib [-m mergeindex]] [-a]
      then either:
             grib2in index2in grib2out
           or:
             -x grib2in grib2out


 DESCRIPTION
      The command copygb2 copies all or part of one GRIB2 file to another
      GRIB2 file, interpolating if necessary.  Unless otherwise directed
      (-x option), the GRIB2 index file is also used to speed the reading.
      The fields are interpolated to an output grid if specified (-g option).
      The interpolation type defaults to bilinear but may be specified directly
      (-i option).  The copying may be limited to specific fields (-k option).
      It may also be limited to a specified subgrid of the output grid
      or to a subrange of the input fields (-B and -b, -A, and -K options).
      Fields can be identified as scalars or vectors (-v option), which are
      interpolated differently.  The invalid data in the output field can be
      filled with mask values or merged with a merge field (-M and -m options).
      The output GRIB2 message can also be appended to a file (-a option).
      If grib2out is specified as '-', then the output GRIB file is written
      to standard output.

    Options
           -a
                          Appends rather than overwrites the output GRIB file.

           -A "<> mapthreshold"     (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                          Inequality and threshold used in determining
                          where on the map the data will be copied.
                          The data are copied only where the given
                          map field is on the correct side of the threshold.
                          The mapthreshold defaults to '>-1.e30'; in this case,
                          only the map field's bitmap will limit the domain.

           -b mapindex     (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                          Optional index file used to get the map field.

           -B mapgrib     (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                          GRIB file used to get the map field.  The map field
                          is read from the GRIB file and compared to the
                          map threshold to determine for which region on the map
                          the data will be copied.  The mapgrib can be the name
                          of an actual GRIB file (in which case the index
                          file may be specified with the -b option) or it can
                          be '-1'.  If mapgrib is '-1', then the input GRIB file
                          (first positional argument) is used.
                          The -K option specifies which field to read from
                          the mapgrib GRIB file.  If mapgrib is an actual file,
                          then the first field is taken if -K is not specified.
                          On the other hand, if mapgrib is '-1', then if the
                          if -K is not specified, the current field is taken
                          as the map field.  A special exception is if -K '-1'
                          is specified, in which case the current field is
                          taken as the map field and it is applied before any
                          interpolation; otherwise the map field is always
                          applied after interpolation.

           -g "kgdtn [kgdt]"
                          Output grid identification. If kgdtn=-1 (the default),
                          then the output grid is the same as the input grid.
                          If kgdtn=-4, then the grid is that of the map field.
                          If kgdtn=-5, then the grid is that of the merge field.
                          If 0<=kgdtn<65535, then kgdtn designates a specific
                          GRIB2 Grid Definition Template (GDT) Number.  In this
                          case, kgdt is the list of the full set of Grid 
                          Definition Template values for the GDT 3.kgdtn, 
                          defining the output grid. 

           -i "ip [ipopts]"
                          Interpolation options.  The default is bilinear
                          interpolation (ip=0).  Other interpolation options
                          are bicubic (ip=1), neighbor (ip=2), budget (ip=3),
                          and spectral (ip=4).  Spectral interpolation is forced
                          even if the input and output grids are the same.
                          See the documentation for iplib for further details.

           -k "kpdtn kpdt"
                          Full set of Production Definition Template parameters
                          determining the field(s) to be copied.  kpdtn is
                          Product Definition Template (PDT) number 4.kpdtn.
                          A wildcard, indicating search all template numbers,
                          is specified by -1 (the default).  The kpdt array
                          contains the values of each entry of PDT 4.kpdtn,
                          and a wildcard for any entry can be specified as
                          -9999.  If the -k is not specified, then copygb will 
                          attempt to copy every field in the input GRIB file.

           -K "mapkpds"     (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                          Full set of kpds parameters determing a GRIB PDS
                          (product definition section) in the W3FI63 format
                          determining the map field to be used to determine
                          where on the map the data will be copied.
                          A wildcard is specified by -1 (the defaults).

           -m mergeindex
                          Optional index file used to get the merge field.

           -M "mask"/mergegrib
                          Mask used to fill out bitmapped areas of the map.
                          If specified, there will be no bitmap in the output.
                          The mask must be in the format '#value' where value
                          is the real number used to fill out the field.
                          Otherwise, the argument is interpreted as a merge
                          GRIB file.  Then for each GRIB message copied,
                          a merge field is found in the merge GRIB file
                          with the same parameter and level indicators
                          as the copied field.  This merge field is interpolated
                          to the output grid and used to fill out the bitmapped
                          areas of the map, at least where the merge field
                          is not bitmapped.  No merging is done if no merge
                          field is found.

           -N namelist     (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                          Namelist file to override default output options.
                          The namelist must start with &NLCOPYGB and end with /.
                          Namelist variables are:
                            IDS(255)      Output decimal scaling by parameter
                            IBS(255)      Output binary scaling by parameter
                            NBS(255)      Output number of bits by parameter

           -v "uparms"
                          Parameter indicator(s) for the u-component of vectors.
                          A specific parameter is indicated by three numbers:
                          disc|cat|num.  Any parameter value in uparms is 
                          defined as (65536*disc)+(256*cat)+num.
                          The parameter indicator for the v-component is assumed
                          to be one more than that of the u-component.
                          If the -v option is not specified, then the wind
                          components (parameters 0|2|2 = 514 and 0|2|3 =515) 
                          are the only fields assumed to be vector components 
                          in the GRIB file.

           -x
                          Turns off the use of an index file.  The index records
                          are then extracted from the GRIB file, which
                          will increase the time taken by copygb.

           -X
                          Turns on verbose printout.  This option is
                          incompatible with GRIB output to standard output.
