          Preliminary Windows XP Notes (Should work this way, I hope)

I've compiled Wgrib2 compiled on Windows XP using the Cygwin system.  
This way should work.

(1) get into the Admin account
(2) download and install cygwin
(3) try to compile
(4) find missing package, download and install, goto 3
(5) finish compiling
(6) relax

However, it doesn't.
