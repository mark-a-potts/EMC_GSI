To build on discover, do the following

(0) cd /path/to/ProdGSI
(1) source g5_modules.sh
(2) module load other/git other/cmake
(3) mkdir bld && cd bld
(4) cmake ..
(5) make -jN

For running regression tests, define the control location in
bld/regression_var.out. Replace CONTROL_EXE-NOTFOUND by the full path to the
gsi executable. Also modify the file bld/CTestTestfile.cmake to exclude the
test global_nemsio_T62 as it is not supported on Discover, yet.
